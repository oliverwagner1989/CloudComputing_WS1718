A scalable and resilient chat-server

Based on your implementation of exercise 3, do the following:

1.     Analyse your code and identify any issue that prevents your current implementation from being run on multiple instances (scaled-out mode). Document these issues!

2.     Devise a solution to overcome the identified issues: provide suitable design documentation for your solutions.

3.     Implement the solution on the IBM Cloud Platform.

4.     Does your scaled-out service survive an instance failure or are any repair actions required? Find arguments that support your statement!

Submission

·      Implement your solution and prepare a presentation and demonstration of your solution

·      Include at least one lesson-learnt item about node.js programming in your document. This can be of any domain, e.g., architecture, coding, or behavioural.

·      Upload documentation and source code (as one zip file) to RELAX. All uploaded files have to contain the name and student ID of all members of your group!

        Do not include any node-modules in your source code but rather define dependencies in package.json!

 

Note that any attempt of cheating, i.e., copying, will result in zero points in the hands-on part of the lecture.
